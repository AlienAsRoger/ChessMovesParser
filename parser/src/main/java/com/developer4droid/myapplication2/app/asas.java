29.Qa3â€¼ { Absolutely not!! A move of
astounding depth. Considering that White's pawn structure is irreparably
ruined after the queen trade, this is an incredibly difficult move to make,
but a GM ain't a GM for nothing! The opening of the b-file  -  ruined pawn
structure aside  -  will allow the White rooks to pressure b7 and d5 (from b5)
simultaneously. Meanwhile, the passivity of Black's pieces will doom any
long-term defense from the start. Appel fails to acknowledge the correctness
of White's idea, and allows Rozentalis to bring the game to an astounding
conclusion. }
