 } 16.Bxh7+! Kxh7 17.Ng5+ Kg6! { This move is never pleasant to make, but the "natural" 17...Kg8 actually plays into White's hands. Now, Black's king has a prime escape route through f6. }  18.Qg4 f5 19.Qg3 { Here Vuckovic claims that the most resilient defense was 19... Rf7!?, but I don't see anything wrong with the text move. It is important not to overestimate the potency of White's attack; with insanely accurate, computeresque defense, Black may well be able to save his king. In an actual game, with Black undoubtedly in time trouble, precise defense is nearly impossible. } 19...Kf6  20.Bf4 Ke7 { Through skillful defense, Black has managed to evacuate his king from the immediate danger zone, but now White switches his attention to the queenside and the center. }  21.Rac1 Ra7? { Black tries to protect the seventh rank, but now White's pieces pour in from all sides. }  22.Rfe1 { Another cold-blooded and remarkably strong move. Black simply cannot keep his position together any longer. } 22...Bd7  23.b4 Na6 24.Nxe6! { A final blow! Black's position comes apart in a picturesque manner: } 24...Bxe6 25.Qxg7+ Rf7 26.Bg5+ Kd7 27.Qh8 Qb8 28.Qxd4+ 1-0
